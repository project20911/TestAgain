S3 Event
A:
- S3: Objects Created, Objects Removed, Object Restore, Objects Replication

- Object Name filtering is possible (* .jpg)

- Use Case: Generate: generate thumbnail of images uploaded to S3

- Can create as many S3 events as desired 

- S3 event notifications typically deliver events in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer

- If two writes are made to a single non-versioned object at the same time, it is possibile that only a single event notification will be sent

- If you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket.

High Performance Computing (HPC)
A:
- The cloud is the perfect place to perform HPC

- You can create a very high number of resources in no time

- You can speed up time to results by adding more resources

- You can pay only for the systems you have used


- Perform genomics, computational chemistry, financial risk modeling, weather prediction, machine learning, deep learning, autonomous driving

- Which service help perform HPC?
-----------
Data Management & Transfer
A:
- AWS Direct Connect:
- - Move GB/s of data to the cloud, over a private secure network

- Snowball & Snowmobile
- - Move PB of data to the cloud

- AWS DataSync
- - Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS, FSx for Windows
-----------
Compute and Networking
A:
- EC2 Instances:
- - CPU optimized, GPU optimized
- - Spot instances / Spot Fleets for cost savings + Auto Scaling

- EC2 Placement Groups: Cluster for good network performance

- EC2 Enhanced Networking (SR-IOV) 
- - Higher bandwidth, higher PPS (packet per second), lower latency 
- - Option 1: Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) up to 100 gbps
-- Option 2: Intel 82599 VF up to 10 Gbps - Legacy

- Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) 
- - Improved ENA for HPC, only works for Linux
- - Great for inter-note communications, tightly coupled workloads
- - Leverages Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
- - Bypasses the underlying Linux OS to provide low-latency, reliable transport
-----------
HPC - Storage
A:
- Instance-attached storage:
- - EBS: Scale up to 64000 IOPS with io I Provisions IOPS
- - Instance Store: scale to millions of IOPS, linked to EC2 instance, low latency

- Network storage
- - Amazon S3: large blob, not a file system
- - Amazon EFS: Scale IOPS based on total size, or use provisioned IOPS
- - Amazon FSx for Lustre
-----------
HPC - Automation and Orchestration
A:
- AWS Batch
- - AWS batch supports multi-node parallel jobs, which enabled you to run single jo bs that span multiple EC2 instances
- Easily schedule jobs and launch EC2 instances accordingly

- AWS ParallelCluster
- - Open source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
- - Configure with text files
- - Automate create of VPC, Subnet, cluster type and instance types
-----------
High Availbility for a Bastion Host
A:
- HA options for the bastion host
- - Run 2 across 2 AZ
- - Run 1 across 2 AZ with 1 ASG 1:1:1

- Routing to the bastion host
- - If 1 bastion host, use an elastic IP with ec2 user-data script to access it
- - If 2 bastion hosts, use an Network Load Balancer (layer 4) deployed in multiple AZ
- - If NLB, the bastion hosts can live in the private subnet directly

- Note: Can't use ALB as the ALB is layer 7 (HTTP protocol)
-----------
Your Lambda function is processing events coming through S3 events and distributed through an SNS topic. You have decided to ensure that events that can not be processed are sent to a DLQ. In which service should you set up the DLQ?
A:
Answer: Lambda function


Note: the invocation is asynchronous (coming from the SNS topic) so the DLQ has to be set on the Lambda side
-----------
You have created an architecture including CloudFront with WAF, Shield, an ALB, and EC2 instances. You would like to block an IP, where should you do it?
A:
Answer: WAF
-----------
Your instances are deployed in an EC2 placement group of type cluster in order to perform HPC. You would like to maximize network performance between your instances. What should you use?
A:
Answer: Elastic Fabric Adapter
