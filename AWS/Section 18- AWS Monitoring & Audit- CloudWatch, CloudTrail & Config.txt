AWS CloudWatch Metrics
A:
- CloudWatch provides metrics for every service(s) in AWS
- Metric is a variable to monitor (CPUUtilization, NetworkIn...)
- Metrics belong to namespaces
- Dimension is an attribute of a metric (instance id, environment, etc ...)
- Up to 10 dimensions per metric
- Metrics have timestaps
- Can create CloudWatch dashboard of metrics
-----------
AWS CloudWatch EC2 Detailed Monitoring
A:
- EC2 instance metrics have metrics "every 5 minutes"
- With detail monitoring (for a cost), you get data "every 1 minute" 
- Use details monitoring if you want to more prompt scale your ASG!

- The AWS FreeTier allows us to have 10 details monitoring metrics

- Note: EC2 Memory usage is by default not pushed ( must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric)
-----------
AWS CloudWatch Custom Metrics
A:
- Possibility to define and send your own custom metrics to CloudWatch

- Ability to use dimensions (attributes) to segment metrics
 - - Instance.id
 - - Environment.name

- Metric resolution:
 - - Standard: 1 minute
 - - High Resolution: up to 1 second (StorageResolution API parameter) - Higher cost

- Use API call PutMetricData

- Use exponential back off in case of throttle errors
-----------
CloudWatch Dashboards

- Using the AWS CLI we can tail CloudWatch logs

- To send logs to CloudWatch, make sure IAM permissions are corect!

- Security: encryption of logs using KMS at the Group level
-----------
CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter & Insights
A:
- CloudWatch Logs can use filter expressions
- - For example, find a specific IP inside of a log
- - Metric filters can be used to trigger alams

- CloudWatch Logs Insights (new - 2018) can be used to query logs and add queries to CloudWatch Dashboards
-----------
CloudWatch Logs for EC2
A:
- By default, no logs from your EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch
- You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want
- Make sure IAM permissions are correct
- The CloudWatch log agent can be setup on-premises too
-----------
CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent
A:
- For virtual servers (Ec2 instances, on-premise servers...)

- CloudWatch Logs Agent
- - Old version of the agent 
- - Can only send to CloudWatch Logs

- CloudWatch Unified Agent
- - Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes, etc...
- - Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs
- - Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store
-----------
CloudWatch Unified Agent - Metrics
A:
- Collected directly on your Linux server / EC2 instance

- CPU 
- Disk Metrics
- RAM
- Netstat
- Processes
- Swap Space



- Reminder: Out of the box metrics for EC2 - disk, CPU, network (high level)
-----------
AWS CloudWatch Alarms
A:
- Alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric
- Alarms can go to Auto Scaling, EC2 actions, SNS notifications
- Various options (sampling, %, max, etc ... )

- Alarm States:
 -- OK
 -- Insufficient_Data
 -- Alarm

- Period
- - Length of time in seconds to evaluate the metric
- - High resolution custom metrics: can only choose 10 sec or 30 sec
-----------
EC2 Instance Recovery
A:
- Status Check: 
- - Instance status = check the EC2 VM
- - System status = check the underlying hardware 


- Recovery: Same private, public, elastic IP, metadata, placement group
-----------
AWS CloudWatch Events
A:
- Schedule: Cron Jobs
- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something
 - - Ex: CodePipline state changes!

- Triggers to Lambda functions, SQS/SNS/Kinesis Messages 
- CloudWatch Event created a smalll JSON document to give information about the change
-----------
AWS CloudTrail
A:
- Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS account
- CloudTrail is enabled by default!
- Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS account by: 
 - - Console
 - - SDK
 - - CLI
 - - AWS Services
- Can put logs from CloudTrail into CloudWatch Logs
- If a resource is deleted in AWS< look into CloudTrail first!
-----------
AWS Config
A:
- Helps with auditing and recording compliance of your AWS resources

- Helps record configurations and changes over time

- Possibility of storing the configuration data into S3 (analyzed by Athena)

- Questions can can be solved by AWS Config:
 - - Is there unrestricted SSH access to my security groups?
 - - Do my buckets have any public access?
 - - How has my ALB configuration changed over time?

- You can receive alerts (SNS notifications) for any changes

- AWS Config is a per-region service

- - Evaluate if each EC2 instance is t2.micro

- Rules can be evaluated / triggered:
 - - For each config change
 - - And / or : at regular time intervals
 - - Can trigger CloudWatch Events if the rule is non-compliant (and chain with Lambda)

- Rules can have auto remediation: 
 - - If a resource is not compliant, you can trigger an auto remediation
 - - Ex: stop instances with non-approved tags

- AWS config rules does not prevent actions from happening (no deny)
-----------

A:
Answer: 1 Second
-----------
Your CloudWatch alarm is triggered and controls an ASG. The alarm should trigger 1 instance being deleted from your ASG, but your ASG has already 2 instances running and the minimum capacity is 2. What will happen?
A:
Answer: The alarm will remain in "ALARM" state but never decreased the number of instances in my ASG`

Note: The number of instances in an ASG cannot go below the minimum, even if the alarm would in theory trigger an instance termination
-----------
An Alarm on a High Resolution Metric can be triggered as often as
A:
10 seconds
-----------
