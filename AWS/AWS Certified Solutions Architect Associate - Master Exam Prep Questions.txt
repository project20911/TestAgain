-----------
How do you change the hosting configuration of a VPC?

A: You can change the hosting value of a VPC by using the CLI, SDK, or API. This will change the hosting settings for new instances only. If you want to change old instances you'll need to stop them and then update the hosting settings via the CLI, SDK, or API.
-----------
What's the difference between default and dedicated hosting of EC2 instances?

A: Dedicated tenancy ensures all EC2 instances that are launched in a VPC run on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Default tenancy means that resources can be shared with multiple customers.
-----------
To allow an EC2 instance to connect to the internet from your VPC via NAT, what must be done to the NAT instance?

A: Each EC2 instance performs source/destination checks by default. This means that the instance must be the source or destination of any traffic it sends or receives. However, a NAT instance must be able to send and receive traffic when the source or destination is not itself. Therefore, you must disable source/destination checks on the NAT instance.
-----------
When should you use AWS Storage Gateway - Tape Gateway?

This means there is an application issue, could be at either the Web Server layer or the Database Layer. 
The gateway has timed out (application is not responding)
-----------
What is the X-Forwarded-For header?

A: This is the true IP address of the individual who hit the load balancer with a request and then the load balancer pushed that request to an EC2 instance. 
It's a way of identify the original request IPv4 address
-----------
When an instance is monitored by an ELB what are the two values the instance can have?

A: InService or OutofService
-----------
What do Health Checks do?

A: These check the instance health by talking to it
-----------
Do Load Blanacers have an IP address?

A: No, load balancers have their own DNS name.
-----------
What are sticky sessions?

A: Enables your users to stick to the same EC2 instance. Can be useful if you are storing information locally to that instance.
This allows you to bind a user's session to a specific EC2 instance. This ensures that all requests from the user during the session are sent to the same instance.
-----------
What is cross zone load balancing?

A: This allows load balancers to send traffic across availability zones. This helps to keep the traffic to instance evenly distributed regardless of the zone the load balancer and instances are in
-----------
What are path patrerns?

A: Allows you to direct traffic to different EC2 instances based on the URL contained in the request. 
You can create a listener with rules to forward requests based on the URL path. This is known as path-based routing. If you are running microservices, you can route traffic to multiple back-end services using path-based routing. For example, you can route general requests to one target group and requests to render images to another target group.

What is a NAT Instance?

A: A NAT instance is an EC2 instance that allows private instances to access the internet. These are out of date and likely shouldn't be used because they are a single source of failure and do not scale well.
-----------
NAT Instance Tips

A: When creating a NAT instance, disable source/destination check on the instance
NAT instances must be in a public subnet
There must be a route out of the private subnet to the NAT instance, in order for this to work
The amount of traffic that NAT instances can support depends on the instance size. If you are bottle-necking, increase the instance size. 
Must be behind a security group 
You can create high availability using Autoscaling Groups, multiple subnets in different AZs, and a script to automate failover...but it's not easy
-----------
What is a NAT gateway?

A: These are redundant inside the availability zone, not a single instance
You can only have on NAT gateway per AZ
Preferred by the enterprise
Starts at 5Gbps and scales currently to 45Gbps
No need to patch
Not associated w/ security group
Automatically assigned a public ip address
Remember to update your route tables 
No need to disable Source/Destination Checks
-----------
NAT gateway best practice, if you have resources in multiple AZ's how many NAT gateways should you have?

A: One for each AZ for high availability. In the event that the NAT gateway's Availability Zone is down, resources in the other availability zones will lose internet access. To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each AZ and configure your routing to ensure that resources use NAT gateway in the same AZ
-----------
How can you block IP Addresses?

A: You can block IP addresses using Netwrok ACLs, not Security groups
-----------
Does your VPC automatically come with a default network ACL?

A: Yes it does and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
-----------
When you create a custom network ACL what are the default inbound and outbound rules?

A: All inbound and outbound traffic is denied by default when you create a custom NACL
-----------
Can a VPC not be associated with a network ACL?

A: No, a VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associated a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
-----------
How many subnets can be associated with a Network ACL?

A: You can associated multiple subnets to one ACL
-----------
How many network ACLs can a subnet be associated with?

A: Only one, subnets cannot to more than one NACL. If you associated a NACL with a subnet, the subnet's previous association is removed.
-----------
What do NACLs do?

A: They contain a numbered list of connection/access rules that is evaluated in order, starting with the lowest number rule
-----------
Do network ACLs have inbound AND outbound rules?

A: Yes, they have separate inbound and out bound rules and each rule can either allow or deny traffic
-----------
Are NACL's stateless?

A: Yes, they are stateless which means responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
-----------
Can you enable flow logs that are peered with your VPC?

A: You cannot enable flow logs for VPCs that are peered with your VPC unless the peer VPC is in your account.
-----------
Can you attach tags to your flow logs?

-----------
What is a bastion host?

A: This is a special-purpose computer on a network specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks. The computer generally hosts a single application, for example, a proxy server, and all other services are removed or limited to reduce the threat to the computer. It is hardened in this manner primarily due to its location and purpose, which is either on the outside of a firewall or in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and usually involves access from untrusted networks or computers.
-----------
What is Direct Connect?

A: This is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises between aws and your datacenter, office, or colocation environment, which in many cases can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.

A: This is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private computer network
-----------
What are UDP protocols?

A: This is a communications protocol that is primarily used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. It speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.
-----------
What is a Route Table?

A: This contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.
-----------
What is an Internet Gateway?

A: A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.
This is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between your VPC and the internet.
-----------
What does an Internet Gateway do in a VPC?

A: This provides a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic, and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses.
-----------
What is a subnet?

A: A range of IP addresses in your VPC.
This is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called submitting. This logically breaks up a VPC.
-----------
What is DNS (Domain Name System)?

A: This is a standard by which names used on the internet are resolved to their corresponding IP addresses. A DNS hostname is a name that uniquely and absolutely names a computer; it's composed of a host name and a domain name.
-----------
What is a VPC endpoint?

A: Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
-----------
Global Accelerator: what is a network zone?

A: A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.
-----------
Global Accelerator: what is a listener?

A: This processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol that you configure. Global Accelerator supports both TCP and UDP protocols. Each one of these has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with one of these by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. Traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with one of these.
-----------
Global Accelerator: what is an endpoint group?

A: Each one of these is associated with a specific AWS Region. These include one or more endpoints in the Region. You can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to one of these by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions.
-----------
Global Accelerator: what is an endpoint?

A: This can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be an internet-facing or internal. Traffic is routed to endpoints based on configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region.
-----------
VPC Endpoints: what is endpoint service?

A: Your own application in your VPC. Other AWS principals can create a connection from their VPC to your endpoint service

-----------
What is the name given to an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure which is used to provide global accelerator services?

A: Similar to Availability Zones, network zones are isolated units with their own set of physical infrastructure and service IP addresses from a unique IP subnet. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable, due to network disruptions or IP address blocking by certain client networks, your client applications can retry using the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.
-----------
An Application Load Balancer must be deployed into at least two subnets?

A: True, ALBs must be in two subnets
-----------
What is the advantage of running your AWS VPN connection through your Direct Connect connection over using the ordinary Internet?

-----------
What is a weighted routing policy?

A: This allows you to split your traffic based on different weights assigned. For example, you can set 10% of your traffic to go to US-EAST-1 and 90% to go to EU-WEST-1.
-----------
What are health checks?

A: In Route53, this is how you can check the health of your different individual records.
-----------
What can health checks enable?

A: If a record fails on of these it will be removed from Route53 until it passes the check. Additionally, you can set up SNS notification to alert you if a check failed.
-----------
What is a latency-based routing policy?

A: This allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for your end user (i.e. which region will give them the fastest response time.) 
Inorder to use this routing policy, you must create a latency resource record set for the EC2 or ELB resource in each region that hosts your website.
-----------
What is a failover routing policy?

A: This is used when you want to create an active/passive set up. For example, you may want your primary site to be in EU-WEST-2 and your secondary DR Site in AP-SOUTHEAST-2. Route53 will monitor the health of your primary site using a health check and route clients to your DR site if a failure is detected.
-----------
What is a geolocation routing policy?

A: This lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users (i.e. the location from which DNS queries originated).
-----------
What is a geoproximity routing policy?

A: This is available in traffic flow only. This allows Route 53 to route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also choose to route traffic to different resources by value, known as a bias.
-----------
What is a multivalue answer routing policy?

A: These let you configure Amazon Route 53 to return multiple values, such as IP addresses for your web servers, in response to DNS queries. You can specify multiple values for almost any record, but multivalue answer routing also lets you check the health of each resource so Route 53 returns only values for healthy resources.
This is similar to simple routing but it lets you put health checks on each record set.

-----------
What are the three different Storage Gateway types?

A: File Gateway (NFS & SMB)
Volume Gateway (iSCSI)
Tape Gateway (VTL)
-----------
What is File Gateway?

A: Files are stored as objects in your s3 buckets, accessed through a Network File System (NFS) mount point. Ownership, permissions, and timestamps are durably stored in s3 in the user-metadata of the object associated with the file. Once objects are transferred to s3, they can be managed as native s3 objects, and bucket policies such as versioning, lifecycle management, and cross-region replication apply directly to objects stored in your bucket.
-----------
What is Volume Gateway?

A: This presents cloud-based iSCSI block storage volumes to your on-premises applications. 
Data written to these volumes can be asynchronously backed up as point-in-time snapshots of your volumes, and stored in the cloud as Amazon EBS snapshots. 
Snapshots are incremental backups that capture only changed blocks. All snapshots storage is also compressed to minimize your storage charges.
-----------
What is Tape Gateway?

This provides your on-premises applications with low-latency access to their entire datasets while providing durable, off-site backups. You can create storage volumes and mount them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Data written to your stored volumes are stored on your on-premises storage hardware. 
This data is asynchronously backed up to Amazon Simple Storage Service (s3) in the form of an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshot. 
1 GB - 16 TB in size for Stored Volumes
-----------
What is Volume Gateway Cached Volumes?

A: The entire Dataset is stored on s3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site. 
This lets you use s3 as your primary data storage while retaining frequently accessed data locally in your storage gateway. 
This minimizes the need to scale your on-premises storage infrastructure, while still providing your applications with low-latency access to their frequently accessed data. 
You can create storage volumes up to 32 TB in size and attach to them as iSCSI devices from your on-premises application servers. Your gateway stores data that you write to these volumes in Amazon s3 and retains recently read data in your on-premises storage gateway's cache and upload buffer storage. 
1GB - 32 TB in size for Cached Volumes.

A: You should use this for anything that will not be accessed frequently but that needs to be available within milliseconds when it is accessed. You'll have to pay a retrieval fee.
-----------
When should you use s3 - Intelligent Tiering?

A: This should probably be the default for frequently accessed s3 objects. The only time you might not want to do this is if you have millions of objects and thus you'll need to pay AWS quite a bit to manage those objects. This the option that uses machine learning to switch between standard and IA
-----------
When should you use s3 one zone - IA?

A: You can use this whenever you have items that don't need to be super available/redundantly stored and that are infrequently access
-----------
When should you use S3 Glacier?

A: This is a good option for archiving objects that still need a relatively fast retrieval time - minutes to hours.
-----------

This is is designed to provide performance for a broad spectrum of workloads and applications, including Big Data and analytics, media processing workflows, content management, web serving, and home directories.
-----------
When can you use a SQS over a Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?

A: Whenever you do not need a response from the caller, you can use SQS. If you need a response, use a load balancer
-----------
When should you use an elastic IP address?

A: When you need to build resilience for external clients connecting to VPCs you should use an elastic IP. Elastic IPs can point clients to different VPCs if one goes down unexpectedly. This decouples the IP address from the identity of the server.

Where do all print statements and logging output show up in Lambda?

A: These are pushed to CloudWatch logs. Cloudwatch logs are key for debugging lambda
-----------
What does RTO stand for?

A: Recovery Time Objective (how long till the system is serviceable)
-----------
What does RPO stand for?

A: Recovery Point Objective (asses a systems fitness) - how much data is lost in recovery
-----------
What's the difference between high availability and fault tolerance?

A: High availability means the system will be on, although it could be degraded. Fault tolerant means the system hides it's failures from end users.
-----------
Is data stored on an EBS automatically replicated within an AZ?

A: Yes, data is replicated across AZs automatically for EBS volumes
-----------
When should you use RDS?

A: RDS provides a managed relational database. It should be used for Complex transactions or complex queries. A medium-to-high query/write rate, no more than a single worker node/shard, and high availability
-----------
When should you not use RDS?

A: When there are massive read/write rates (e.g. 150K write/second), Sharding is required, Simple get/put requests and queries, when you need RDBMS customization
-----------
How can you scale RDS instances?

A: You can scale up, by increasing the size of the instance. Additionally you can create read replicas, used as copies of your RDS instance but only for reading data.

-----------
Which RDS DB options support read replicas?

A: MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Aurora - it's supported for everything but Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
-----------
What's the difference when comparing caching of ElastiCache and CloudFront?

A: ElastiCache sits infront of your database and caches often requested data, instead of requiring you to ask for it from your DB. CloudFront caches web assets at edge locations, making it faster for end users to see and consume your data.
-----------
What's the difference between ElastiCache Memcached and Redis?

A: Memcached is simpler and easier to set up. Memcached is used for low maintenance, multithreading, easy horizontal scalability with Auto Discovery. Redis supports data structures, atomic operations, pub/sub messaging, read replicas/failover, cluster mode/sharded clusters - it's more advanced and used for more complex db caching needs.
-----------
What's the benefit of cloudfront for content delivery?

-----------
What's the best way to scale horizonatly in AWS?

A: Use AWS Auto Scaling. Auto Scaling can launch and terminate instances across AZs. It can automatically register new instances with load balancers.
-----------
What components of AWS allow you to scale EC2 instances?

A: Auto Scaling - is alerted to add or remove instances 
Cloud Watch - used to set alarms for CPU usage or similar, showing there is a need for more instances 
Elastic Load Balancer - allow you to send traffic to an EC2 or scaled EC2 instances
-----------
What is the template that AutoScaling uses to launch fully configured instances automatically?

A: Auto Scaling uses Launch Configurations
-----------
What is an Auto Scaling Launch Configuration?

A: Specifies EC2 instance size and AMI name
-----------
What is an Auto Scaling Group?

A: References the launch configuration, specifies min, max, and desired size of the Auto Scaling Group, may references an ELB, Health Check Type
-----------
What is an Auto Scaling Policy?

A: Specifies how much to scale in our scale out. One or more may be attached to Auto Scaling group
-----------
If you have a known time that there will be a traffic spike for your EC2 instances, what's the best way to resolve it?

A: Create an auto-scaling group that has a schedule increase at the specific time you know there will be increase traffic. Ensure there is enough time for the EC2 instances to scale up.
