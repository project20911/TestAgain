What is Snowball?
A:
- Physical data transport solution that helps moving TBS or PBs of data in or out of AWS
- Alternative to moving data over the network (and paying network fees)
- Secure, tamper-resistant, uses KMS 256 bit encryption
- Tracking using SNS and text messages. E-ink shipping label
- Pay per data transfer job
- Use cases; large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery
- If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use Snowball devices!
-----------
What is a Snowball Edge?
A:
- Snowball Edges add computational capability to the device
- 100 TB capacity with either
- - Storage optimized - 24 vCPU
- - Compute optimized - 52 vCPU & optional GPU

- Supports a custom EC2 AMI so you can perform processing on the go
- Supports custom Lambda functions

- Very useful to pre-process the data while moving
- Use case: data migration, image collation, IoT capture, capture, machine learning
-----------
What is AWS Storage Gateway?
A:
- Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
- Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage

- 3 types of Storage Gateway
- - File Gateway
- - Volume Gateway
- - Tape Gateway
-----------
What is File Gateway?
A:
- Configured S3 buckets are accesible using the NFS and SMB protocol
- Supports S3 standard, S3 IA, S3 One Zone IA
- Bucket access using IAM roles for each File Gateway
- Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
- Can be mounted on many servers
-----------
What is Volume Gateway?
A:
- Block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by S3
- Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on-premise volumes!
- Cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data
- Stored volumes: entire dataset is on premise, scheduled backups to S3
-----------
What is Tape Gateway?
A:
- Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes (!)
- With Tape Gateway, companies use the same processes but in the cloud
- Virtual Tape Library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 and Glacier
- Back up data using existing tape-based processes (and iSCSI interface)
- Works with leading backup software vendors
-----------
AWS Storage Gateway Summary (important notes for exam)
A:
- Exam tip: Read the question well, it will hint at which gateway to use
- On premise data to the cloud => Storage Gateway

- File access / NFS => File Gateway
- Volume / Block Storage / iSCSI => Volume gateway
( backed by S3 with EBS snapshots)
- VTL Tape solution / Backup with iSCSI => Tape Gateway
( backed by S3 and Glacier)
-----------
When would you need a File Gateway hardware appliance?
A:
- Using a file gateway means you need virtualization . . . 
- Otherwise, you can use a File Gateway Hardware Appliance
- You can buy it on amazon.com

- Helpful for daily NFS backups in small data centers
-----------
Amazon FSx for Windows (File Server)
A:
- EFS is a shared POSIX system for Linux systems.

- FSx for Windows is a fully managed Windows file system share drive
- Supports SMB protocol & Windows NTFS
- Microsoft Active Directory integration, ACLs, use quotas
- Built on SSD, scale up to 10s of GB/s, millions of IOPS, 100s of PB of data
- Can be accessed from your on-premise infrastructure 
- Can be configured to be Multi-AZ (high availability)
- Data is backed-up daily to S3
-----------
Amazon FSx for Lustre
A:
- Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, for large-scale computing 
- The name Lustre is derived from "Linux" and "cluster"


- Machine learning, High performance Computing (HPC)
- Video Processing, Financial Modeling, Electronic Design Automation
- Scales up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies
- Seamless integration with S3
 - - Can "read S3" as a file system (through FSx)
 - - can write the output of the computations back to S3 (through FSx)
- Can be used from on-premise servers
-----------
Overall Storage Comparison
A:
- S3: Object Storage
- Glacier: Object Archival
- EFS: network File System fro Linux instances, POSIX filesystem
- FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
- FXx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
- EBS volumes: Network storage for one EC2 instance (high IOPS)
- Instance Storage: Physical storage for your EC2 instance (high IOPS)
- Storage Gateway: File Gateway, Volume Gateway (cache & stored), Tape Gateway
- Snowball / Snowmobile: to move large amount of data to the cloud, physically
- Database: for specific workloads, usually with indexing and querying
-----------
You need to move hundreds of Terabytes into the cloud in S3, and after that pre-process it using many EC2 instances in order to clean the data. You have a 1 Gbit/s broadband and would like to optimize the process of moving the data and pre-processing it, in order to save time. What do you recommend?
A:
Use Snowball Edge

Snowball Edge is the right answer as it comes with computing capabilities and allows use to pre-process the data while it's being moved in Snowball, so we save time on the pre-processing side as well.
-----------
You want to expose a virtually infinite storage for your tape backups. You want to keep the same software as today and want a iSCSI compatible interface. What do you use?
A:
Tape Gateway
-----------
Your EC2 Windows Servers need to share some data by having a Network File System mounted, that respect the Windows security mechanisms and has integration with Active Directory. What do you recommend putting in place as an NFS?
A:
FSx for Windows
-----------
You would like to have a distributed POSIX compliant file system that will allow you to maximize the IOPS in order to perform some HPC and genomics computational research. That file system will have to scale easily to millions of IOPS. What do you recommend?
A:
FSx for Lustre
